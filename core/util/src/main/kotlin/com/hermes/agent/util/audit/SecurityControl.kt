/**
 * Phase 4 security audit checklist — Section 8 of the plan.
 *
 * A programmatically-checkable list of security controls. Each control
 * has a [status] the app reports on the Settings → Security screen
 * so users (and reviewers) can see at a glance what's enforced and
 * what's still pending.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth — the Settings UI, the worklog,
 * and the security review doc all reference these enum values. Add a
 * new control here when you ship a new security feature; don't sprinkle
 * ad-hoc "is X enabled" booleans elsewhere.
