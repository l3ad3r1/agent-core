/**
 * Shared instruction appended to a system prompt whenever tools are offered.
 *
 * Models differ wildly in how they emit tool calls when not using OpenAI's
 * structured `tool_calls` field: Nous/Nemotron use `<TOOLCALL>[…]</TOOLCALL>`,
 * while Gemma 3 (function calling is pure prompt-engineering, no tool tokens)
 * defaults to ```tool_code``` Python-call syntax that the app can't parse.
 *
 * Rather than parse every dialect, we pin a single text format —
 * `<tool_call>{json}</tool_call>` — which instruction-tuned models reliably
 * follow and which [com.hermes.agent.data.llm.CloudLlmProvider]'s fallback
 * parser already recovers. Structured `tool_calls` (when the provider supports
 * it) still takes precedence.
